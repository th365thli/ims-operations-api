# IMS Operations API

IMS Operations API allows users to use RESTFul APIs to submit IMS commands for managing IMS resources in support of application deployment and other IMS operations needs.

IMS Operations API is coded in Java and uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build. Additionally, it is recommended you install an application server such as [Websphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/) or [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/). Familiarity with the above products is recommended, though there are helpful tutorials in each of the links. 

We recommend using an IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) for your development environment. For setting up your development environment and installation and usage of the API, visit our [Getting Started](https://github.ibm.com/ims/ims-operations-api/wiki/Getting-Started) page.

DOPT PSBs are not loaded at IMS restart, they are loaded every time the program is scheduled. When the program is scheduled for the first time, IMS does not know the language until after the program is scheduled in a region and the PSB is loaded. Unless LANG(JAVA) is defined for the DOPT(Y) program, the program is incorrectly scheduled in a non-Java region.
